# Data Exploration Repository for Health Analytics

## Overview

Welcome to my Health Analytics Data Exploration Repository! This repository aims to show the health informatics research and innovation, with a focus on diabetes risk prediction and telemedicine in the COVID-19 age. I have provided datasets and machine learning algorithms to help with in-depth research and model building.

## Datasets

### Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction

- **Description:** This dataset comprises medical records of patients categorized as diabetic and non-diabetic. It's designed to aid in the early prediction of diabetes risk.
- **Fields:** Includes patient demographics, and  medical history indicators.
- **Format:** CSV

### COVID Time Telemedicine Data

- **Description:** This dataset captures the dynamics of telemedicine consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering insights into healthcare delivery changes.
- **Fields:** Contains information on patient consultations, types of medical services rendered.
- **Format:** CSV

## Code for Machine Learning-Based Classification

- **Languages Used:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow (if applicable)
- **Features:** Scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training (classification algorithms), and evaluation metrics.

## Ideas for Exploration

1. **Risk Prediction Modeling:** Utilize the diabetes dataset to develop predictive models for early-stage diabetes risk. Experiment with different classification algorithms and compare their performance.

2. **Telemedicine Service Analysis:** Analyze the telemedicine dataset to understand how healthcare services evolved during the pandemic. Focus on patient demographics, types of services, and satisfaction levels.

3. **Cross Analysis:** Investigate any correlations between diabetes risk and the usage of telemedicine services during COVID-19.

4. **Time Series Analysis:** Perform a time series analysis on the telemedicine data to identify trends and patterns over the pandemic period.

5. **Feature Engineering:** Explore creating new features from existing data to improve model accuracy for diabetes risk prediction.

6. **Data Visualization:** Create interactive visualizations to represent findings from both datasets.
